```javascript
// This component uses the wrong lifecycle method to update the state.
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    // This method should only update state based on props
    // It's called before render and should return an object to update state or null if no update is needed
    console.log('getDerivedStateFromProps', props, state);
    return { count: props.count }; // This will cause an infinite render loop because of the next line
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    // This method is called after the component is mounted into the DOM
    // It should be used for side effects such as network requests or subscriptions
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); // This line causes an infinite render loop.
  }

  render() {
    return <div>Count: {this.state.count}</div>;
  }
}
